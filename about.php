    <p>R. Brock is a software developer who likes web comics but doesn't much care for drawing. 
    But you can't have a web comic, at least not a good one, without some drawing. And now you know
    the story.</p>
    <p>Currently using the wife's hand me down Intuos 4 and Photoshop CC 2017 for the drawing of the comics.
    Comics are drawn whenever and however is convenient at the time, which accounts for the disparate styles.</p>
    <p>The website is a custom PHP codebase and uses Foundation and Vuejs for the frontend. Why PHP? It's traditional.</p>
